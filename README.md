# NovaExplorers
The Skylinker is an innovative drone-based solution developed by Nova Explorers, a student robotics team from Morocco. The project aims to provide emergency internet and cellular connectivity using drones.

This repository contains the software that powers the Skylinker. It is a simplified version of the original code developed for the World Robotic Olympiad competition in 2023.

# Overview
The Skylinker drone carries telecommunication equipment that allows it to broadcast WiFi and cellular signals. It can fly to areas experiencing network outages, such as hospitals, schools, logistical facilities, and remote/risky regions, to restore critical connectivity. This has the potential to save lives and aid disaster response efforts.

# Technologies
This software uses two main Node.js libraries:

tl-api: Interfaces with TP-Link router APIs to retrieve network information
arduino-iot-js: Sends data to the Arduino Cloud dashboard

# Setup
To run the software:

Install Node.js
Run npm install to install dependencies
Run npm run nova to start the app
